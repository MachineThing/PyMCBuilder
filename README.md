# Python Minecraft image builder
This program builds an image that the user specifies into Minecraft using 9 different blocks.
## Color algorithm
How the color algorithm will work is that the program will compare each pixel to a dictionary (basically a special type of Python lists) of 9 different blocks, resulting in poor quality for images with boat loads of different colors but good quality for images with few colors. ~~The program will show what the image might look like in game.~~ *Mason please add*

**Note: I will add more blocks in the future**
